requested sinkhole traffic is possible indicator of an infected computer that is reaching out to controller that has been taken over by law enforcement or research organization as part of malware mitigation effort traffic to sinkhole should be examined for characteristics of automated activity in some cases an administrator be curious about particular domain and browse to it triggering the

resolve sinkhole domain alerts directly to the portal no explicit notification but events will be available for reporting purposes in the portal sincerely soc technical details the domain name system dns is hierarchical naming system for any resource connected to the internet or private network which has the primary purpose of associating various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities it is primarily used for translating domain names to the numerirtcal ip addresses for the purpose of locating service and devices on network the domain name system distributes the responsibility of assigning domain names and mapping those names to ip addresses by designating authoritative name servers for each domain authoritative name servers are assigned to be responsible for their supported domains and delegate authority over subdomains to other name servers the domain name system also specifies the technical functionality of this database service it defines the dns protocol detailed specification of the data structures and data communication exchanges used in dns as part of the internet protocol suite dns sinkholes are dns servers that give out incorrect information in order to prevent the use of the domain name for which ip address resolution is being attempted when client requests to resolve the address of sinkholed hole or domain the sinkhole returns non routable address or any address except for the real address this germanytially denies the client connection to the target host using this method compromised clients can easily be found using sinkhole logs another method of detecting compromised hosts is during operations in which servers being used for command and control purposes are taken over by law enforcement as part of malware mitigation effort traffic to sinkhole should be examined for characteristics of automated activity in some cases an administrator be curious about particular domain and browse to it triggering the signature repeated automated requests to sinkhole are clear indication of infection by trojan of some sort connections to sinkholes seem somewhat benign but the ramdntyifications certainly include information leakage to some extent although sinkhole operators are unlikely to use any personally identifiable information they capture from trojan communication it become public knowledge that company is infected with which lead to reputational damage additionally some sinkholes are feeding ip addresses of victims to beshryulists which impede access to certain services like sending email finally some trojans connect to multiple controller domains hostnames and even though some of them be sinkholed there be others that are not leading to the possibility of remote code execution or
